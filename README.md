# Git workshop

This one-hour hands-on workshop 
([notes here](https://github.com/mbonsma/git-workshop/blob/master/git-workshop.md#hands-on-workshop-notes))
introduces version control using Git.

This material is based on the [Software Carpentry Git workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) 
and a [UofT Coders workshop](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/git/intro/lesson/).

This [slide show](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IjOyrn7ZN8QRMtKzXdKg3epWTQRCSwYgKleJHj7--cM/edit?usp=sharing) 
can be paired with the material as well.
